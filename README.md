In this application you will create a to-do list application that can do the following:

1. Users should be able to view all of the to-do tasks (Checklist: Freedom. #1 Doing dishes #2 Starting the roomba #3 Folding the cloths. If all 3 steps = true then play music)

2. Users should be able to add a to-do to the list of to-do tasks (Checklist is a living document. )

3. Users should be able to mark a task as completed by crossing it out on click (click or crossout)

4. Users should be able to remove to-do tasks by removing those elements from the DOM (ask instructors later)

5. The page should be aesthetically pleasing (aka be styled)

------------------------------
RECOMMEDED PATH 

- Start by adding the HTML code. This is like the skeleton of the page, so add a title, list, form, input, buttons, etc...
- Add your JavaScript
    - Create a variable that will hold your to-do list items.
    - Add a function that takes in a string as input and adds it to the to-do list.
    - Add an event handler to populate an HTML element with your to-do list when the user clicks the appropriate button.
    - Etc... break down the big problems into baby steps and solve them systematically. Test as you go.
- With the main functionality in place, style your HTML elements using CSS. Make use of the developer console for testing styling.
- Finished with the main objectives? Continue on to the stretch goals to make your application even better.
